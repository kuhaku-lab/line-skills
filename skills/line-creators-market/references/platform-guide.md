## AI Usage Declaration

Creators can declare whether AI was used to create or process their products (stickers/emoji/themes).

- Set via the **"AI Usage"** field during product creation or editing
- When set to "Uses AI", a label is automatically displayed on the purchase page in LINE Sticker Shop, Theme Shop, and LINE STORE
- **Must accurately reflect actual usage** — LINE may change the setting based on their judgment
- Products imitating copyrighted characters via AI generation are prohibited
- LINE may request the AI prompts/instructions used during creation; inability to provide may result in rejection or delisting
- For products already on sale: changing only the AI usage flag to "Uses AI" does not require re-review
- After changing AI usage setting, it takes up to 24 hours to apply

Creator Share = (Premium Total Sales x 30%) x (Users of this product / Total users of all Premium products)
```

- Numerator: number of Premium subscribers who used/applied this product
- Denominator: total user count across all Premium-eligible products (each product counted separately)

**Review Timeline:**

- Check portrait rights guidelines before using real-person photos

**Handling Rejected Stickers (App → Web Workflow):**

- Rejected app stickers are treated as new sticker sets on resubmission (cannot reuse same set name)

**Limitations vs Web (Creators Market):**

- Cannot stop sales or manage payment accounts through the app — must use web dashboard
- Cannot edit stickers already submitted for review or on sale — must use web
- Rejected stickers are treated as new sticker sets on resubmission (cannot reuse same name)
- Animated stickers created in app cannot be saved to device or shared (static stickers can)
- Only supports static + animated stickers (no custom, message, big, popup, effect, emoji, or themes)
