# LINE MINI App Guidelines

## What is LINE MINI App

LINE MINI App is a web application that runs on LINE. "LINE MINI App" is the official name. Users use their LINE account to access services within LINE without downloading a separate app. Developers provide services without building a native app.

**Platform scale (November 2025):** 17.5 million monthly active users, 27,800+ released services.

**Common use cases:** Digital membership cards, mobile ordering, reservation & queue management, coupons & stamp cards, games & entertainment, campaigns.

**Industries:** Retail, food service, beauty, sports, education, real estate, finance, government.

LINE MINI App is built on LIFF. All [LIFF app development guidelines](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/development-guidelines/) also apply. Basic rules are based on [Terms and Policies](https://developers.line.biz/en/terms-and-policies/) and the [LINE MINI App Policy](https://terms2.line.me/LINE_MINI_App?lang=en).

> **Future:** LIFF and LINE MINI App will be integrated into a single brand. See [features.md § LIFF vs MINI App Differences](features.md#liff-vs-mini-app-differences) for details.

See [features.md § External Browser](features.md#external-browser-behavior) and [announcement](https://developers.line.biz/en/news/2025/09/26/mini-app-browser/)
- **Two API types**: LIFF API (called from the MINI App client) and Service Message API (called from server-side). LIFF API is constantly being improved

---

## Performance Guidelines

Use [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) or [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to measure performance.

| Tool | Recommended Score |
|------|------------------|
| Lighthouse | Performance: **50 and above** |

**Measurement notes:**
- Measure **without** executing LINE Login (otherwise the Login page performance is measured, not the MINI App)
- Measure in the **production environment** (network can affect the score)

See [Performance guidelines](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/develop/performance-guidelines/).

## Development Recommendations

- Use HTML5 [Geolocation API](https://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation/) for locating users
- Utilize LINE profile information (via LIFF API) to auto-fill forms and reduce manual entry (e.g., restaurant reservations)
- Optimize performance to meet the recommended Lighthouse score
- Design for external browser access — ensure core features work without LINE Login

## Migrating a Web App to LINE MINI App

To implement an existing web app as a LINE MINI App:

1. **Create** a LINE MINI App channel (see [console-setup.md](console-setup.md))
2. **Load** the LIFF SDK (CDN: `https://static.line-scdn.net/liff/edge/2/sdk.js` or npm: `@line/liff`)
3. **Initialize** with `liff.init({ liffId: "..." })`
4. **Implement** features: LIFF API (login, profile), Service Messages, HTML5 APIs
5. **Configure** the Endpoint URL in the channel settings
6. **Submit** for review (unverified → verified)

A Business ID is required to access the LINE Developers Console.

See [Implementing web apps as LINE MINI Apps](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/develop/web-app/).

## Development Rules

### Prohibiting Mass Requests

Do NOT send mass requests to the LINE Platform for load testing via:
- LIFF scheme (`https://miniapp.line.me/{liffId}`)
- LIFF API
- Service Message API

For load testing, prepare a test environment that does not generate requests to the LINE Platform.

Rate limit exceeded → `429 Too Many Requests`.

## Saving Logs

**LINE does not provide logs.** Developers must save their own logs.

### Service Message API Request Logs

Save the following for each Service Message API request:

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Time | `Mon, 16 Jul 2021 10:20:23 GMT` |
| Request method | `POST` |
| API endpoint | `https://api.line.me/message/v3/notifier/send?target=service` |
| Status code | `200` |
| `notificationToken` | From response |

**Also useful to log:**
- Request body
- Full response body (beyond `notificationToken`)

## Deauthorize on User Unregistration

When a user **unregisters** from your MINI App or **terminates the link** between your app and LINE:

1. **Call the deauthorize endpoint** on behalf of the user:
   ```
   POST https://api.line.me/user/v1/deauthorize
   ```
   See [Deauthorize API](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/line-login/#deauthorize).

2. **Disclose in terms/registration flow** that unregistration will notify LY Corporation and terminate the link. Examples:
   - "If you unsubscribe from the service, LY Corporation will be notified and the link between the service and LINE app will be terminated."
   - "If you do this, LY Corporation will be notified and the link between the service and LINE app will be terminated."

### Why This Matters

When a user authorizes a MINI App, it appears in LINE app **Settings > Account > Authorized apps**. If you don't deauthorize on unregistration, the permissions remain authorized even after the user leaves your service.

See [Managing authorized apps](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-login/managing-authorized-apps/).

---

## Quick Fill Design Regulations

> **Violating these rules may result in Quick-fill permission being revoked.**

For full visual examples, see [Common Profile Quick-fill design regulations](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/quick-fill/design-regulations/).

### Recommended Screen Transitions

When integrating Quick-fill, use one of these recommended patterns:

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Immediate modal | Call `get()` immediately when user navigates to registration screen. Place Auto-fill button so user can re-trigger if modal is closed |
| On form focus | Call `get()` when user selects an input field on the form |
| On button tap | Call `get()` when user taps the Auto-fill button |
| Post-consent | After user taps **Allow** on the channel consent screen, transition directly to registration screen and call `get()` immediately. Place Auto-fill button for re-triggering |

### Prohibited Screen Transitions

| Violation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Modal without form | Displaying the Quick-fill modal on a screen that has no form to auto-fill |
| Requesting unused scopes | Getting profile items that don't exist in the form (e.g. requesting phonetic info when there's no kana field) |
| Skipping auto-fill | Moving to confirmation/completion screen after user taps Auto-fill without actually filling the form fields |

### Auto-fill Button Guidelines

LINE provides **4 types / 13 button variants**. You must use these official buttons — custom buttons are prohibited.

**Critical rules:**
- Use buttons **as-is** — no modifications, animations, or effects
- **Do not** zoom, rotate, skew, italicize, add shadows/borders/3D, overlay elements, or hide the button
- **Do not** add text below the button or use custom replacement buttons
- Align button with **left or center** of the form input field
- Leave **10px margin** on all sides of the button
- Place button where the user can **see the form** that will be filled
- **Load button images from the official URL** — do not download and host. URLs may change with notice

### Button Types

| Type | Size | Variants | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| A | 264×73px | 4 colors (black, white, gray, blue) | With Account Center branding |
| B | 264×73px | 4 colors (black, white, gray, blue) | Simple style |
| C | 264×73px | 1 (white only) | With LY branding |
| D | 288×66px | 4 colors (white, black, gray, blue) | With LINE branding |

**Note:** Button images are served at 2x size. Display at the specified dimensions, not the raw image size.

### Button URLs

### Normal Mode

| Edge | Padding |
|------|---------|
| Bottom | 34px |

```css
{
  padding-bottom: 34px;
}
```

### Landscape Mode

|------|---------|
| Left | 44px |
| Right | 44px |
| Bottom | 21px |

```css
{
  padding-right: 44px;
  padding-bottom: 21px;
  padding-left: 44px;
}
```

See [Safe area for landscape mode](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/design/landscape/).
