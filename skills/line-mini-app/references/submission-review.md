# Submission & Review Process

> **Prerequisite:** LINE MINI App channels start as unverified with restricted features. To become verified, the app must pass review by LY Corporation.

> **Taiwan / Thailand:** Verification review is open to any eligible developer (the prior "certified provider only" restriction was lifted in March 2026). Review and verification still apply.

## Review Period

- If rejected: allow a few more days for re-application and re-review
- **Cannot specify a completion date**

## Multiple MINI Apps

To submit multiple LINE MINI Apps:

1. Submit **one** first
2. After that app is approved, request **batch review** for the remaining apps

## After Approval

### First-time submission

```
Status flow: "Approved" → immediately "Reflected" (live, but not yet searchable)
```

1. Status automatically changes to "Approved" → immediately "Reflected" (app is live and accessible via URL, but **not searchable** in LINE yet)
2. Use the **Search enable** button on the Review request tab to make the MINI App searchable in LINE
3. If Search enable is **not clicked within 30 days** → auto-enabled at 9:00 AM JST on day 31 (may delay 1–2 hours)
4. After search is enabled, status returns to "Not yet reviewed" — settings can be changed and resubmitted

### Re-review (already published)

```
Status flow: "Approved" → (manual) → "Reflected"
```

1. Status changes to "Approved"
2. Use the **Publish changes** button to change status to "Reflected"
3. If Publish changes is **not clicked within 30 days** → auto-reflected at 9:00 AM JST on day 31
4. After reflection, status returns to "Not yet reviewed"

**Changes do not affect the published MINI App** until the review passes AND Publish changes is clicked (or auto-reflected after 30 days).

For which Console settings trigger a re-review, see [console-setup.md § Re-review](console-setup.md#re-review-after-updating-a-verified-mini-app).

## Provider Certification

| Region | Effect of passing review |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Japan** | Provider becomes a **certified provider** |
| Other regions | No automatic certification |

Certified provider status affects features like the [OA friend add-friend option](features.md#oa-friend-inducement-add-friend-option) being enabled by default.
